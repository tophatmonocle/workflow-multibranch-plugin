# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence
# More information see https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# Our goal is not to exhaustively document code ownership via CODEOWNERS,
# only to use it for areas that are sensitive enough to justify the
# gatekeeping oversight (both the overhead for the team owning it, and the
# additional drag it causes on other teams when they contribute to it).

# When making changes, do so in a separate PR and list the changes and the
# reasons why in the PR description. Thanks!

# Possible rules
# * @team1 --> Own everything in the repo
# *.js @team2 --> Own every js file in the repo
# /src/js/ @team3--> Own every file and all subdirectories in /src/js/
# /src/*  @team4 --> Own every file in src/, but NOT the subdirectories
# /src/*.md  @team5 @team6 --> Both team5 and team6 own all markdown files in /src/ (note no comma)
